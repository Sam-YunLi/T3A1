<!-- Provides an extensive overview and description of a standard source control process -->

Source control orl Version control is the process of recording, tracking, maintaining and controlling a series of changes generated by partial improvements to the same product or system in order to meet different requirements.

By understanding how the Source Control flow works on the large project. There are the example here.

1. The project manager will create the main project repository on the service after the basic rule of the source control been established by the leader or the project manager, which will start with the skeleton structure of the project, and this main branch will be the univesal version of this project and product that will become customers in the future. 

2. The project manager divides the project into parts as needed and assigns them to different teams, each of which is responsible for only one part of the project. The team leader will further break down the task and break down the task to each developer. An admin or team of admins will handle how the team modifies the main branch.

3. After all work has been assigned, each developer will copy or clone the repository code to their local machine, so they can do their work locally instead of the main branch, which will give developers enough freedom to additions or modifications, and the integrity of the source code are preserved.

4. Once the developer finish their part, they can submit their change to the main branch and 












## Qustion 2
<!-- What are the most important aspects of quality software? -->
<!-- List discuss and demonstrate 6 software quality characteristics.
Shows almost flawless understanding of the high level structure of the app -->

Like other products, software products have quality requirements. Software quality is related to the degree of useage and service life of the software. A high-quality software is more popular with users. In addition to meeting the explicit needs of customers, it often also meets customer implicit needs, like the product interface is more beautiful and the user operation is simpler.

Software quality is a concern of both users and developers, but it is not easy to evaluate the quality of a software product comprehensively and objectively. The most common practice is to evaluate the quality of a piece of software according to the ISO/IEC 25010: 2011. It not only defines software quality, but also establishes a normative process for software testing, including the writing of test plans and the design of test cases. he product quality model defined in ISO/IEC 25010 comprises the eight quality characteristics, which are:

- Functional suitablity
    The functions realized by the software reach the degree of its design specifications and meet the needs of users, emphasizing correctness, completeness, suitability, etc. It involoves Functional completeness, functional correctness and functinal appropriateness.

- Efficiency
    Under certain conditions, the time characteristics of the software (such as response speed) and the degree to which a function can effectively utilize computer resources (including memory size, CPU usage time, etc.), and high local resource occupancy are usually performance bottlenecks. ; The number of concurrent users and connections that the system can sustain depends on the scalability of the system. It concerns Time-behavior, resource utilization and capacity.

- Compatibility
    Coexistence and interoperability, coexistence requires software to be compatible with system platforms, subsystems, third-party software, etc., and appropriate processing for internationalization and localization. Interoperability requires effective interface between system functions, involving APIs and file formats, etc. It concerns co-existence and inteoperability.

- Usability
    For a software, the degree to which the user learns, operates, prepares the input and understands the output, such as being simple and convenient to install, easy to use, user-friendly, and suitable for users with different characteristics, including the disabled and the handicapped. Effective ways or means of product use. It concerns appropriateness recognisability, learnability, operability, user error protection, user interface aesthetics and accessibility.

- Reliability
    The probability that the software can maintain its normal functional operation and performance level under the specified time and conditions, such as the higher the maturity, the higher the reliability; MTTF (mean time to failure) or MTBF (mean time Between failures,  to measure reliability. It concerns maturity, availability, Fault tolerance and recoverability.

- Security
    It is required to ensure its security in terms of data transmission and storage, including user identity authentication, data encryption and integrity verification, all key operations have records (log), and can review the actions of different user roles. It concerns confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, verifiability and authenticity.

- Maintainability
    When a software is put into operation, the requirements change, the environment changes, or the software fails, the degree of effort to make corresponding changes. It modularity, reusability, analyzability, modifiability and testability.

- Portability
    The ease with which software can be ported from one computer system or environment to another, or how easily a system can work with external conditions. It involves adaptability, installability and replaceability.

## Question 7
<!-- Explain control flow, using an example from the JavaScript programming language -->
<!-- Provides a thorough explanation of control flow in programming -->
Control flow is the order or sequence of execution in a programming language. Like other programming languages, control flow is an integral part of JavaScript, and it relies heavily on control flow to take actions based on situations or conditions.

### Conditionals
When you need to performance different actions based on different conditions, you will need the conditional statements. in JS we have IF ELSE and switch conditional statements
#### if/ if else/ if else if else
If else statement is simple, when the condition after if is true, then the code in `{}` will be executed, if the conditional is false then the code after if will be pass, then the code after else will be executed. For example:

- if
``` javascript
const a = 2;
if (a > 0) {
    console.log('a is bigger than 0');
}

if (a < 0) {
    console.log('a is smaller than 0');
}

// result: a is bigger than 0
```
In this example the first condition `(a > 0)` is true, so the code in `{console.log('a is bigger than 0');}` will be executed, but the second condition `(a < 0)` is false, so the code in `{console.log('a is smaller than 0');}` will be passed. so the result is `a is bigger than 0`.

- if else
``` javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 3;

if (a > b) {
    console.log('a > b is true')
} else {
    console.log('a > b is false')
}
//result:  a > b is false
```
Because the `(a > b)` condition is false so the code `{ console.log('a > b is true') }` will be passed and the code after `else` `{console.log('a > b is false')}` will be executed. So the result will be `a > b is false`

- if else if else
``` javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 3;
const c = 4;

if (a > b) {
    console.log('a > b')
} else if (b > c) {
    console.log('b > c')
} else {
    console.log ('none of them is right')
}
//result: none of them is right
```
In this example the condition `(a > b)` is false so move to the `else if `check the condition `(b > c)` , this conditon false as well, so move to the `else`, the code `{console.log ('none of them is right')}`  will be executed. So the result is `none of them is right`.

### switch
Switch statement works with conditional aswell, but unlike the if else statement, switch statement take in an expression  and evaluates it once. If any of the preceding cases match the expression, then the code in that expression will be excuted.

``` javascript
const day = new Date().getDay();

switch (day)) {
  case 1:
    console.log('Today is Monday.');
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log('Today is Tuesday.');
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log('Today is Wednesday.');
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log('Today is Thursday.');
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log('Today is Friday.');
    break;
  default:
    text = "It's Weekend.";
}
```

In this example, the `day` will give a number from 0 to 6, means Sunday to Saturday. Switch statement take expression `day`, for example the today is monday so the day will be 1, then match the second case, then excute the code after the second case. Until meet the `break` jump out from the switch statement or finish this switch statement.

### loop
A loop statement is an iteration statement, it will keep running until the condition fails or nothing is left to loop.
in JS we have for loop and while loop.

### for loop
The for loop statement will have an conditional, the loop will keep executing until the condition is false.

``` javascript
const pets = ['dog','cat','fish'];

for (let i = 0 ; i < pets.length ; i++) {
  console.log('My pet is ' + pets[i]);
}>)

// My pet is dog
// My pet is cat
// My pet is fish
```
In this example, we set the `i = 0` first, then check the condition `i < pets.length` is true, so the loop will run then we print the `my pet is dog`. After the code in the block excuted, `i++` excuted. then we check the condition again. This will keep run until the condition `i < pets.length` is false.

The two special way to use the for loop is for/in and for/of. Normally they used with the object or array. 
for/in is loop the properties of an object (keys).
for/of is loops the values of an iterable object (values).
They will running to the end of the object or array.
for example:
``` javascript
const peoples = { name: 'Alex', nickname: 'Big rock', age: 18}
let keys = [];
let values = [];

for (let key in peoples) {
  keys.push(key);
}
console.log(keys);

// ['name', 'nickname', 'age']

for (let value of peoples) {
  values.push(value);
}
console.log(values);

// ['Alex','Big rock', 18]
```

### while loop
While loop is really similar to the for loop, the loop will keep run until the contional is false.

``` javascript
const pets = ['dog','cat','fish'];

while (pets.length > 0) {
  const pet = pets.pop();
  console.log('My pet is ' + pet);
})

// My pet is fish
// My pet is cat
// My pet is dog
```
In this example, we can see that the while loop is really like the for loop, each time in the loop will pop out one of the element. The loop will keep running until the `pets.length > 0` false.

``` javascript
const pets = ['dog','cat','fish'];

do {
  const pet = pets.pop();
  console.log('My pet is ' + pet);
}) while (pets.length <= 0);

// My pet is fish
// My pet is cat
// My pet is dog
```
do/while loop is same with the while. only different is the code will run once then check the condition, if the condition is true, keep looping, if the condition is false, break the loop. for example:

### break
Break could jump out from the loop, without check the condition.
for example:
``` javascript
for( let i = 0; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
  if ( i == 1 ) { break; }
  console.log( i );
}

// 0
```
When the `i == 1` we meet the `break`, it will jump out from the for loop.

### continue
Continue breaks one iteration then continue the next iteration.
``` javascript
for( let i = 0; i < 3 ; i++ ) {
  if ( i == 1 ) { continue; }
  console.log( i );
}

// 0
// 2
```
When the `i == 1` we meet the `countinue`, the code after continue is not executed, then go to next iteration `i = 2`.

## Question 8.
<!-- Explain type coercion, using examples from the JavaScript programming language -->

Type coercion is one kind of process that could convert one type of value to another type.
In javascript there are three type of the conversion. 
- to string.
- to number.
- to boolean.

Type coercion could be Implicit or Explicit. 
Implicit type coercion or type casting means the developer convert type of value by writing the appropriate code.
For example:
``` javascript
console.log(typeof Number("888")); // 888 => 'number'
console.log(typeof String(12345)); // '12345' => 'string'
console.log(typeof Boolean(0)); // false => 'boolean'
```
Explicit type coercion means in some situaction the type of value could change automatically, it's normally happens when apply operators to values of different types.
``` javascript
const x = 4 / '5'; 
console.log(x); // 0.8
console.log(typeof x); // 'number'
// String '5' convert to number 5, without use Number('5').

console.log('Hi.' + 5); // 'Hi. 5'
// Number 5 convert to string '5'.

let zero = 0 ? true: false;
console.log(let); // false
// Number 0 convert to boolean false.
```

There are only have 6 false values in JavaScript.
``` javascript
console.log(Boolean(''));          // false
console.log(Boolean(0));           // false Boolean(-0) is false as well
console.log(Boolean(NaN));         // false
console.log(Boolean(null));        // false
console.log(Boolean(undefined));   // false
console.log(Boolean(false));       // false
```
All the other value that not belong to these 6 will converted to true, including object, function, array etc.
``` javascript
console.log(Boolean({});            // true
console.log(Boolean([]));           // true
console.log(Boolean(function() {}));// true
```

There are some special cases:
- `==` and `!=` will only check the value but not the type, JS will try to convert the type and compair them.
- `===` and `!==` check both value and type.
- when `null` or `undefined` on the side of the `==`, they not convert `null` or `undefined` to number. `null` only equals to `null` or `undefined`.
- `NaN` does not equal to anything even it self.
``` javascript
console.log(5 == '5');              // true
console.log(5 === '5');             // false

console.log(Number(null));          // 0
console.log(null == 0);             // false
console.log(undefined == null);     // true

console.log(NaN == NaN);            // false
```
